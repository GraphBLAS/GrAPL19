\section{LAGraph Repository}
\label{sec:repo}

The hypothesis underlying the GraphBLAS is that algorithm designers can focus on expressing their algorithms
in terms of the high level linear algebra operations defined in the GraphBLAS while leaving low level
optimizations to any particular hardware platform to the implementor of the GraphBLAS.  Ultimately, 
we want hardware vendors to be responsible for creating highly tuned versions of the GraphBLAS
specialized to the features of their systems.

Algorithm designers will naturally wonder how much performance is lost due to the use of a high 
level API such as the GraphBLAS.  We believe the GraphBLAS bring inherent efficiency advantages to 
a graph algorithms due to the more structures access to data afforded by the sparse linear algebra 
formats.  This is an untested hypothesis, however, since until now, we have not had multiple 
implementations of a high level API tuned to the features of a range of platforms.

Testing this hypothesis of the performance potential afforded by the GraphBLAS is a major outcome
we anticipate from the LAGraph project.  By collecting high level graph algorithms and validating them
across an engaged community, we will produce the library of algorithms needed to evaluate the 
effectiveness of the GraphBLAS approach.

Before we can conduct such experiments, however, we need to collect graph algorithms implemented on 
top of the GraphBLAS. We have created a git hub repository for members of the LAGraph community to 
use to contribute GraphBLAS algorithms. The basic elements of the repository include:
%% ToDo: check line by line against the repository and make sure this is complete
\begin{itemize}
\item A Build System for creating the LAGraph library and the test routines.
\item A library of utilities for loading matrices from disk and evaluating results
\item A directory of graph algorithms.
\item A directory holdling a test harness for each alorithm
\end{itemize}

We will write documentation, a programer's reference guide and define procedures for how people
can add new algorithms.
