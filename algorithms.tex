\section{Algorithms targeted by LAGraph}
\label{sec:algorithms}

Many graph algorithms have been successfully implemented in the language of linear algebra. Below is a non-exhaustive list with references to their implementations:

\begin{itemize}
\item Breadth-first search (BFS)~\cite{bulucc2011parallel, gbtl-cuda16, Davis19}, including the direction optimizing BFS~\cite{Yang:2018:IPE}.
\item Shortest-path (both single-source~\cite{Yang:2019:GBL, ssspgrapl19} and all-pairs~\cite{ca_apsp}) calculation
\item Centrality measures, such as Betweenness centrality~\cite{combblas}
\item Triangle counting and enumeration~\cite{} as well as k-truss enumeration~\cite{}
\item Connected components~\cite{lacc2019}
\item PageRank~\cite{satish2014navigating}
\item Graph coloring~\cite{}
\item Subgraph counting~\cite{chen2019graphblas}
\item Maximal independent set~\cite{jpdc15, Yang:2019:GBL}
\end{itemize}

Machine learning algorithms are also implemented using libraries that are in the spirit of GraphBLAS:
\begin{itemize}
\item Clustering, such as Markov clustering~\cite{azad2018hipmcl} and peer-pressure clustering~\cite{}
\item Deep neural network inference~\cite{kepner2017enabling}
\item Collaborative filtering with Stochastic Gradient Descent~\cite{satish2014navigating}
\end{itemize}

Finally, there are algorithms we consider to be important but has so far not been implemented using a GraphBLAS-like library:
\begin{itemize}
\item A* search
\item Graph neural network training and inferences
\item Branch and bound
\item Graph kernels for supervised learning
\end{itemize}
