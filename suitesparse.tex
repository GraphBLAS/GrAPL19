SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS is the first full implementation of the GraphBLAS
standard, and is available at \url{http://suitesparse.com}
\cite{Davis19}.

% defines a set of sparse matrix operations on an extended algebra of semirings
% using an almost unlimited variety of operators and types.  When applied to
% sparse adjacency matrices, these algebraic operations are equivalent to
% computations on graphs.  GraphBLAS provides a powerful and expressive framework
% for creating graph algorithms based on the elegant mathematics of sparse matrix
% operations on a semiring.

The design of a GraphBLAS library is flexible, because its data structures are
opaque to the user.  SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS uses a compressed-sparse vector
data structure, in four different forms.  A matrix can be stored in
row-major order (CSR), or column-major order (CSC).  Each sparse vector
consists of a sorted list of indices, and the corresponding numerical values.
The sparse vectors are packed together into two arrays, and another ``pointer
array'' (of size equal to the dimension of the matrix, say $n$) keeps track of
where each row (or column) starts.  The memory taken is $O(n+e)$ for a CSR
matrix with $n$ rows or a CSC matrix with $n$ columns, and with $e$ entries.
Most graphs have $e=O(n)$ entries, but some graphs (and in particular,
subgraphs) can be {\em hypersparse} \cite{BulucGilbert08}, with $e << n$.  In
the hypersparse form, the pointer array itself becomes sparse, and non-empty
vectors take no space at all.  The space is reduced to $O(e)$, so that
matrices with enormous dimensions can be created, as long as $e << n$.
SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS exploits hypersparsity automatically, and all
methods can operate on all four matrix formats in any combination.

The ability to incrementally modify a graph is critical in many applications.
GraphBLAS includes two operations that can make small incremental changes to a
graph/matrix:  namely \verb'GrB_setElement' and \verb'GrB_assign'.  It would be
exceedingly slow to insert or delete a single entry in a CSR or CSC format,
taking $O(n+e)$ time {\bf per entry} inserted or deleted.  Instead, the
non-blocking aspect of GraphBLAS is exploited.  Fast deletion of entries is
handled by creating {\em zombies}, which are entries tagged for later deletion.
Fast insertion is handled with {\em pending tuples}, which is a separate
unordered list of $(i,j,a_{ij})$ for each new entry.  When a matrix operation
occurs (such as matrix multiply), all zombies are killed and all pending tuples
are assembled, in a single $O(n+ e + p \log p)$ step (for $p$ pending tuples),
or $O(e +p \log p)$ in the hypersparse case.  As a result, it is just as fast
to use a sequence of $e$ \verb'GrB_setElement' operations to build a matrix, as
it is to create an array of $e$ tuples and use \verb'GrB_build'.  Internally,
SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS is building the list itself, for the user, and then does
a \verb'GrB_build' when the matrix needs to be completed.

To enable high-performance matrix-matrix multiply, a code generation mechanism
is used to build functions for each semiring that can be created with built-in
operators.  The functions can rely on Gustavson's method \cite{Gustavson78}, a
dot product method, and heap-based method, all with masked variants.  A current
prototype of the package adds an early exit mechanism for the MIN, MAX, OR, and
AND monoids, where a dot product can terminate as soon as a terminal value is
found in the result (\verb'true' for OR, for example).  This will enable a fast
direct-optimizing BFS to be written, where the ``pull'' is a dot product, and
the ``push'' a saxpy-based operation (Gustavson's or the heap method).

Since its implementation was requested as the GraphBLAS reference
implementation, testing is a vital component to the package.  In
SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS, each GraphBLAS operation was written twice: once in
high-performance algorithms in C, and again in a very simple and short MATLAB
script, using dense matrices with of the required type.  For example,
\verb'GrB_assign' requires about 3,908 lines of C (not counting comments), but
only 161 lines in MATLAB.  The pattern in the MATLAB version is held as a
separate Boolean matrix.  The MATLAB functions are not intended to be fast.
Instead, they exactly mimic the GraphBLAS API Specification, line by line, so
they can be visually inspected for conformance to the spec.  For example,
matrix multiply is written with a triply-nested \verb'for' loop.  Then, to test
the package, each computation is done in SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS (via a MATLAB
interface) and in the MATLAB mimic.  The tests pass only if the results are
identical in both value and pattern (even with identical floating-point
roundoff error, in most cases).

SuiteSparse:GraphBLAS appears in Debian and Ubuntu Linux distros, and has been
released as part of the RedisGraph database module of the Redis database
systems, by RedisLabs, Inc.  (\url{https://oss.redislabs.com/redisgraph/}).
