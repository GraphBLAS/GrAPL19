\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

The GraphBLAS forum started its work in 2013 to standardize the building blocks for 
graph algorithms formulated from linear algebra expressions~\cite{hpec13}.  We now
have a C specification for the GraphBLAS~\cite{cspec} and multiple 
implementations~\cite{Davis19,GPI,gbtl-github}.   The next 
step in this journey is to define a library of high level graph algorithms
that are based on the GraphBLAS.  

The GraphBLAS was a community effort launched by a position paper.
This is a position paper to launch LAGraph project, our community effort to 
collect and validate 1) a set of high quality basic graph algorithms that run 
on top of the GraphBLAS, and 2) support libraries for development of graph analytics 
applications.  Example of support libraries are I/O, generation of scale-free graphs,
basic measurements on graphs, and changing representation of graphs.  
We urge readers interested in joining us as we
work on LAGraph to contact any of the authors of this position paper.
