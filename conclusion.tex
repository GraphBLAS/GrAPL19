\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

The GraphBLAS forum started its work on standard building blocks for 
graphs in the language of linear algebra in 2013~\cite{hpec13}.  We now
have a C specification for the GraphBLAS~\cite{cspec} and multiple 
implementations~\cite{Davis19, ibmGraphBLAS}.   The next 
step in this journey is to define a library of high level graph algorithms
that are based on the GraphBLAS.  

The GraphBLAS was a community effort launched by a position paper.
This is a position paper to launch LAGraph, our community effort to 
collect and validate a set of high quality graph algorithms that run 
on top of the GraphBLAS. We urge readers interested in joining us as we
work on LAGraph to contact any of the authors of this position paper.
